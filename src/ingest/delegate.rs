//! ActiveSupport's `delegate :a, :b, to: :target` → real methods.
//!
//! Rails defines these with `class_eval` at load time, so nothing about
//! them survives into an emitted tree: the declaration lands in
//! `unknown_calls` and every call to a delegated name is a bare send no
//! class defines. The failure is SILENT wherever the caller rescues —
//! campfire's `message_presentation` wraps its whole body in `rescue
//! Exception` and returns `""`, so a missing `fragment` rendered every
//! message with an EMPTY body and no error anywhere. The search page
//! looked like it had no results; it had one, drawn blank.
//!
//! [`super::current_attributes`] already expands the declaration for
//! `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes` subclasses, where the target is a
//! declared attribute and the forwarder can read its ivar directly.
//! This is the general case: the target is a METHOD (campfire's
//! `attr_reader :content` beside the declaration), so the forwarder
//! CALLS it, which is also what Rails' generated body does.
//!
//! ## Where it declines
//!
//! A delegated method that takes ARGUMENTS. Rails forwards them with
//! `*args, &block`; argument forwarding is the shape the strict targets
//! do not lower ([[project_kwarg_forwarding_strict_targets_gap]]), and
//! a zero-arg forwarder for a method that takes two is an arity error
//! standing in for a NameError — a different wrong answer, not a fix.
//! The test is the declaring class's own call sites: campfire's
//! `Messages::AttachmentPresentation` delegates `:tag`, `:link_to` and
//! four more `to: :context` and calls every one of them WITH arguments
//! in the same file, so that declaration stays in `unknown_calls`,
//! visible, exactly as it is today.
//!
//! The limitation that leaves: a declaration in a BASE class whose only
//! argument-passing callers are subclasses reads as zero-arg here.
//! campfire has no such case — `ActionText::Content::Filter`'s
//! `fragment` is a reader on both sides — and closing it properly means
//! the arity coming from the TARGET's own signature rather than from
//! call sites.
